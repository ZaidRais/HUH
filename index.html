            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Education in India is primarily managed by state-run public education
                system, which fall under the command of the government at three levels: federal, state and local. Under
                various articles of the Indian Constitution and the Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education
                Act, 2009, free and compulsory education is provided as a fundamental right to children aged 6 to 14.
                The approximate ratio of public schools to private schools in India is 7:5. Major policy initiatives in
                Indian education are numerous. Up until 1976, education policies and implementation were determined
                legally by each of Indiaâ€™s constitutional states.</p>

            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">The pre-primary stage is the foundation of children's knowledge, skills
                and behaviour. On completion of pre-primary education, the children are sent to the primary stage but
                pre-primary education in India is not a fundamental right. In rural India, pre-primary schools are
                rarely available in small villages. But in cities and big towns, there are many established players in
                the pre-primary education sector. The demand for the preschools is growing considerably in the smaller
                towns and cities but still, only 1% of the population under age 6 is enrolled in preschool education.

            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">At the primary and secondary level, India has a large private school
                system complementing the government run schools, with 29% of students receiving private education in the
                6 to 14 age group. Certain post-secondary technical schools are also private. The private education
                market in India had a revenue of US$450 million in 2008, but is projected to be a US$40 billion
                market.</p>
                <p class="sectionSubTag text-small"></p>
                As per the Annual Status of Education Report (ASER) 2012, 96.5% of all rural children between the ages
                of 6-14 were enrolled in school. This is the fourth annual survey to report enrolment above 96%. India
                has maintained an average enrolment ratio of 95% for students in this age group from year 2007 to 2014.
                As an outcome the number of students in the age group 6-14 who are not enrolled in school has come down
                to 2.8% in the academic year 2018 (ASER 2018). Another report from 2013 stated that there were 229
                million students enrolled in different accredited urban and rural schools of India, from Class I to XII,
                representing an increase of 2.3 million students over 2002 total enrolment, and a 19% increase in girl's
                enrolment.[20] While quantitatively India is inching closer to universal education, the quality of its
                education has been questioned particularly in its government run school system. While more than 95 per
                cent of children attend primary school, just 40 per cent of Indian adolescents attend secondary school
                (Grades 9-12). Since 2000, the World Bank has committed over $2 billion to education in India. Some of
                the reasons for the poor quality include absence of around 25% of teachers every day. States of
                India have introduced tests and education assessment system to identify and improve such schools.</p>
